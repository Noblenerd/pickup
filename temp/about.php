				Nigeria Property Centre is Nigeriaâ€™s number one property website. We are not estate agents but we aim to be the place for Nigerian property seekers to find details of all properties available to buy or rent. <br><br>

We have created a significantly more convenient and effective way for property hunters to find their next property: up-to-date property information, available for free, accessible 24 hours a day to anyone with internet access and far more complete in terms of number of properties and depth of detail on each property than through other traditional advertising media. <br><br>

Nigeria Property Centre connects more people with more property than anyone else. <br><br>

Nigeria Property Centre is the clear leading property website with lots of users, advertising members and properties. Our advertisers are property professionals such as estate agents, letting (rental) agents and new homes developers who offer properties within Nigeria for property hunters. <br><br>

localhost was founded by Nnamdi Chineme (also co-founder of Choosist) and is operated by Dilmak Solutions Ventures Limited, a privately held company in Nigeria. <br><br>

Dilmak Solutions Ventures Limited, 533 Ikwerre Road, Rumuigbo, Port Harcourt, Rivers State. <br><br>
Registered in Nigeria with RC No. 1114378 <br><br>
